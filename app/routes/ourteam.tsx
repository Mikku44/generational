                <div className="">GENERATIONAL was founded by Kajkanit “Gem” Sakdisubha — a lifelong
                  car enthusiast and entrepreneur — together with a close group of friends
                  who share his deep passion for classic automobiles.</div>

              <AnimatedSection>
                <div className="text-[20px] font-medium">Gem’s fascination with cars began at the age of six, behind the wheel of a
                  red toy Countach he drove around his family’s vacation home in Khao Yai.
                  Years later, while studying architecture in Milan and Bangkok, his
                  appreciation for design matured — particularly the sculptural beauty
                  found in automotive form. </div>

              <AnimatedSection>
                <div className="text-[20px] font-medium">Before founding GENERATIONAL, Gem launched a successful startup
                  and co-founded a professional association, serving as both CEO and
                  President. These years of building, leading, and creating laid the
                  foundation for what would become his most personal venture.</div>

                <div className="text-[20px] font-medium">At what he calls the “ripe moment” — with enough experience behind him
                  and encouragement from the people around him — Gem set out to bring
                  his long-held dream to life: a company devoted to timeless machines,
                  worthy of being passed down through generations. Thus, the name was born.

                  automotive design, and his belief in cars not only as kinetic art, but as
                  meaningful investments, emotional totems, and lifelong dreams made
