              FOUNDER
            </div>
            <div className="grid gap-4">
              <div className="">GENERATIONAL was founded by Kajkanit “Gem” Sakdisubha — a lifelong
                car enthusiast and entrepreneur — together with a close group of friends
                who share his deep passion for classic automobiles.</div>
              <div className="">Gem’s fascination with cars began at the age of six, behind the wheel of a
                red toy Countach he drove around his family’s vacation home in Khao Yai.
                Years later, while studying architecture in Milan and Bangkok, his
                appreciation for design matured — particularly the sculptural beauty
                found in automotive form. </div>
              <div className="">Before founding GENERATIONAL, Gem launched a successful startup
                and co-founded a professional association, serving as both CEO and
                President. These years of building, leading, and creating laid the
                foundation for what would become his most personal venture.</div>
              <div className="">At what he calls the “ripe moment” — with enough experience behind him
                and encouragement from the people around him — Gem set out to bring
                his long-held dream to life: a company devoted to timeless machines,
                worthy of being passed down through generations. Thus, the name was born.
              </div>
              <div className="">GENERATIONAL is Gem’s magnum opus — a love letter to the beauty of
                automotive design, and his belief in cars not only as kinetic art, but as
                meaningful investments, emotional totems, and lifelong dreams made
                tangible
              </div>

            {/* Design Above All */}
            <div className="mt-10">
              <div className="text-xl font-medium mb-2">
                Design Above All
              </div>

              <div className="">We look for timeless design-sculptural forms, precise lines, and details that have aged with grace.
                From the muscular arches of the Lamborghini Countach LP400, to the sculpted elegance of the Ferrari 250 GT/L "Lusso",
                and the purity of the Porsche 911,
                we study these automobiles as if they were architecture on wheels - because they are.</div>
            </div>
            {/* Provenance & Originality */}
            <div className="mt-10 grid gap-4">
              <div className="text-xl font-medium mb-2">
                Provenance & Originality
              </div>

              <div className="">A car is only as valuable as its condition.
                We prioritize vehicles with clear provenance, verified histories from previous owners,
                original components, service records from respected garages,
                and minimal modifications.</div>
              <div className="">We believe art is best left untouched once it has passed through the hands of its creator -
                you don't alter the Mona Lisa's smile. It's perfect as it is.</div>
            </div>

            {/* Driving Experience */}
            <div className="mt-10 grid gap-4">

                Driving Experience
              </div>

              <div className="">We believe a classic car should be driven, not just displayed.
                Every vehicle we source must deliver an emotional response behind the wheel - sound,
                feel and mechanical character. We don't bring cars all the way to Thailand just for her to sit in the garage waiting for parts -
                the soul of the car must be alive.</div>

                Rarity with Relevance
              </div>

              <div className="">Not every rare car is collectible.
                We curate models that matter: culturally significant and racing pedigree,
                or underappreciated legends whose time</div>

              <div className="">Our philosophy is rooted in the long view.
                These are vehicles not just for today - but for tomorrow's curators,
                collectors, and connoisseurs. We exist to find, protect, and deliver those cars.</div>
